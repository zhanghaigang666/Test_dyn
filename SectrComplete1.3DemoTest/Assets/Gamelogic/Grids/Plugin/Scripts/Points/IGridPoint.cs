	/// <summary>
	/// Represents a "point" that is used to access a cell in a Grid. 
	/// 
	/// For built-in 2D grids, these points are often 2D integer vectors, or spliced vectors, and hence they implement
	/// additional interfaces such as IVectorPoint, ISplicedPoint, andISplicedVectorPoint.These points supports
	/// arithmetic, [colorings](http://gamelogic.co.za/2013/12/18/what-are-grid-colorings/), and some other geometric operations. 
	/// 
	/// In general, points do not "know" their neighbors.Use the grid methods IGrid&lt;TCell, TPoint&gt;.GetNeighbors and
	/// IGrid&lt;TCell, TPoint&gt;.GetAllNeighbors to make queries about a point's neighbors.
	/// 
	/// GridPoint base classes must be immutable for many of the algorithms to work correctly.In particular,
	/// GridPoints are used as keys in dictionaries and sets.
	/// 
	/// It is also a good idea to overload the `==` and `!=` operators.
